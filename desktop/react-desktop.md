If youâ€™ve built a React web app and want to take it to the next level by making it available on desktop platforms, youâ€™re in the right place! This guide will help you transform your React application into a desktop app using Electron, the most popular framework for building cross-platform desktop applications with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

By following these steps, youâ€™ll unlock new possibilities for your app, delivering a better user experience and making it accessible beyond the browser.

Why Convert Your React App to a Desktop App?
Before diving into the technical details, letâ€™s explore why you might want to convert your React app into a desktop app:

Offline Access: A desktop app can work offline, providing users uninterrupted access to your application without an internet connection.
System Integration: Desktop apps can integrate more deeply with the operating system (file systems, notifications, and hardware access).
User Experience: Desktop apps offer a different experience than browser-based apps, such as customized window controls and context menus.
Monetization: Desktop apps can be distributed through platforms like the Windows Store or the Mac App Store.
Step 1: Setting Up Electron
To convert your React app to a desktop app, we will use Electron. Electron combines Chromium and Node.js to build desktop apps with JavaScript. Essentially, itâ€™s like wrapping your React app in a web browser but delivering it as a desktop app.

Install Electron in Your React Project
First, start by installing Electron:

npm install electron --save-dev
Step 2: Create main.js
Next, create a main.js file in the root of your project. This file will control the main process of your desktop app.

const { app, BrowserWindow } = require('electron');
const path = require('path');
let mainWindow;
function createWindow() {
  mainWindow = new BrowserWindow({
    width: 800,
    height: 600,
    webPreferences: {
      preload: path.join(__dirname, 'preload.js'),
      nodeIntegration: true,
    },
  });
  mainWindow.loadURL('http://localhost:3000'); // Load your React app
  mainWindow.on('closed', function () {
    mainWindow = null;
  });
}
app.on('ready', createWindow);
app.on('window-all-closed', function () {
  if (process.platform !== 'darwin') {
    app.quit();
  }
});
app.on('activate', function () {
  if (mainWindow === null) {
    createWindow();
  }
});
Hereâ€™s a quick breakdown of whatâ€™s happening in main.js:

We create a new browser window with BrowserWindow.
We load our React app (running on localhost:3000).
We handle the window-all-closed event to quit the app when all windows are closed.
Step 3: Update package.json
Add Electron as the start script for the desktop version. In package.json, add this to your scripts section:

"scripts": {
  "start": "react-scripts start",
  "build": "react-scripts build",
  "electron": "electron ."
}
Now you can run:

npm run electron
This will start Electron and load your React app in a desktop window. ðŸŽ‰

Step 4: Build Your React App for Production
Once youâ€™ve confirmed everything works, itâ€™s time to build the React app. Run:

npm run build
This will bundle your React app into static files, which you can load into Electron.

Step 5: Load Your Built React App in Electron
Update your main.js file to load the production build instead of localhost:3000. Replace:

mainWindow.loadURL('http://localhost:3000');
With:

mainWindow.loadFile(path.join(__dirname, 'build/index.html'));
Step 6: Package Your App
To package your desktop app, you can use Electron Builder, which simplifies the process of creating installers for your app.

Install Electron Builder:

npm install electron-builder --save-dev
Update your package.json to include a build section:

"build": {
  "appId": "com.example.react-desktop",
  "productName": "React Desktop App",
  "directories": {
    "output": "dist"
  },
  "files": [
    "build/**/*",
    "main.js"
  ],
  "mac": {
    "category": "public.app-category.utilities"
  },
  "win": {
    "target": "nsis"
  }
}
Now you can package your app by running:

npm run electron:build
This command will create a packaged app in the dist folder, ready to be distributed!

Bonus: Engaging With System APIs
One of the coolest things about turning your React app into a desktop app is the ability to engage with system APIs. For example, you can display native notifications, interact with the file system, or even create system tray icons.

Hereâ€™s a quick example of how to show a native notification:

const { Notification } = require('electron');
function showNotification() {
  const notification = {
    title: 'React Desktop App',
    body: 'Your desktop app is running successfully!',
  };
  new Notification(notification).show();
}
app.on('ready', showNotification);
Now, when your app starts, itâ€™ll show a native notification to the user. Imagine the possibilities!

Wrapping Up
Converting your React app into a desktop app opens up a world of new opportunities. With Electron, you can deliver a powerful, cross-platform desktop experience without needing to rebuild your entire app. Now youâ€™ve got a fully functional desktop app from your React project â€” go out there and make something awesome!

The Road Ahead
You can dive deeper into Electronâ€™s documentation to unlock even more features, such as system tray icons, advanced file handling, and deep OS integration. The journey doesnâ€™t end here!

Happy coding, and welcome to the world of desktop development!
