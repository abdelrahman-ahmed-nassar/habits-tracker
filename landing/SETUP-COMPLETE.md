### 2. Downloads Folder Created ✅

- Created `landing/downloads/` directory
- Added `prepare-downloads.bat` script to automate packaging
- Added `.gitignore` to prevent committing large zip files

### 3. Netlify Configuration ✅

- Created `netlify.toml` with proper headers for downloads
- Set `Content-Disposition: attachment` for zip files
- Configured cache headers for better performance
- Set base directory to `landing`

### 4. Documentation ✅

- Created `DEPLOYMENT.md` with step-by-step Arabic/English guide
- Updated downloads `README.md` with usage instructions
- Documented alternative hosting options (GitHub Releases)

## Next Steps for You

### 1. Prepare the Zip Files

```bash
cd landing\downloads
prepare-downloads.bat
```

**Note**: You'll need to build a Windows executable first, or the script will skip Windows. Build it with:

```bash
cd ..\..\backend
pnpm run build:executable
```

### 2. Deploy to Netlify

**Option A: Via Netlify Dashboard** (Easiest)

1. Go to https://app.netlify.com
2. "Add new site" → "Import from Git"
3. Select your GitHub repo: `habits-tracker`
4. Base directory: `landing`
5. Publish directory: `.`
6. Deploy!

**Option B: Via Netlify CLI**

```bash
npm install -g netlify-cli
netlify login
cd landing
netlify deploy --prod
```

### 3. Set Custom Domain (Optional)

- In Netlify: Site settings → Domain settings
- Suggested: `modawim.netlify.app` or buy `modawim.com`

## Important Notes

### File Size Limits

- **Netlify Free**: 100MB per file, 300 builds/month
- If your executables are larger, use **GitHub Releases** instead:
  1. Create release on GitHub
  2. Upload zip files there
  3. Update links in `index.html` to GitHub URLs

### GitHub Releases Alternative

If files are too large, update the download links to:

```html
<a
  href="https://github.com/abdelrahman-ahmed-nassar/habits-tracker/releases/latest/download/modawim-windows.zip"
  class="download-btn"
  download
>
  <i data-lucide="monitor"></i>
  <span>Windows</span>
</a>
```

## Testing Locally

Before deploying, test locally:

```bash
cd landing
# If you have Python:
python -m http.server 8000

# Or with Node.js:
npx serve .

# Then visit: http://localhost:8000
```
